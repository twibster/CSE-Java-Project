# Functionality
Controllers
The controllers module contains the JavaFX controllers for managing the user interface. It requires the javafx.controls and javafx.fxml modules, as well as the spring.security.core and spring.security.crypto modules for security-related functionality. The module exports the frontend.controllers package to make it accessible to other modules.

# Configuration
